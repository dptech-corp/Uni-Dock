  summary: A GPU-accelerated molecular docking program
  description: >
    Uni-Dock is a GPU-accelerated molecular docking program developed by DP Technology.
    It supports various scoring functions including vina, vinardo, and ad4.
    Uni-Dock achieves more than 1000-fold speed-up on V100 GPU with high-accuracy,
    compared with the AutoDock Vina running in single CPU core.
    The paper has been accepted by JCTC (doi: 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01145).

# Uni-Dock

Uni-Dock is a GPU-accelerated molecular docking program developed by DP Technology.
It supports various scoring functions including vina, vinardo, and ad4.
Uni-Dock achieves more than 2000-fold speed-up on V100 GPU with high-accuracy compared with the AutoDock Vina running in single CPU core.
The [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01145) has been accepted by JCTC (doi: 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01145).

## Installation

Uni-Dock officially supports NVIDIA GPUs with [compute capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported) >= 7.0 on Linux platform.
The performance is not guaranteed on legacy GPU models. To build Uni-Dock with a customized compute capability, please change the `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` variable in `CMakeLists.txt` to the corresponding value.

### Building from source

1. Install dependencies

     - CUDA toolkit >= 11.8: Please refer to the [installation tutorial](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) provided by nvidia.
     - CMake >= 3.16
     - A C++ compiler (should be [compatible with NVCC](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#host-compiler-support-policy); `g++` works for most cases)
     - Boost >= 1.72

          ```bash
          sudo apt install libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-timer-dev
          ```

          Alternatively, download Boost from source by adding `-D FETCH_BOOST=ON` when compiling (see step 3).

          If the above methods don't satisify, install from [boost source codes](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) or from [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/libboost) with `conda install -c anaconda libboost`.

2. Clone repo or retrieve source code from [release page](https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Dock/releases):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Dock.git
   ```

3. Build Uni-Dock using CMake:

     ```bash
     cd Uni-Dock/unidock
     cmake -B build
     # or the following if you want to use FetchContent to install boost
     # cmake -B build -D FETCH_BOOST=ON
     cmake --build build -j4
     cmake --install build # This will add `unidock` to the default installation path for executables.
                           # Otherwise, prepend the building directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
     ```

To format codes if changes are made:

```shell
cd ./build/
make clang-format
```

### Using binary

Please download the latest binary of Uni-Dock at the assets tab of [the Release page](https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Dock/releases).
Executable `unidock` supports vina and vinardo scoring functions, and `unidock_ad4` supports ad4 scoring function.

After downloading, please make sure that the path to `unidock` is in your `PATH` environment variable.

## Usage

### Example

To launch a Uni-Dock job, the most important parameters are as follows:

- `--receptor`: filepath of the receptor (PDBQT)
- `--gpu_batch`: filepath of the ligands to dock with GPU (PDBQT), enter multiple at a time, separated by spaces (" ")
- `--search_mode`: computational complexity, choose in \[*`fast`*, *`balance`*, and *`detail`*].

***Advanced options***
`--search_mode` is the recommended setting of `--exhaustiveness` and `--max_step`, with three combinations called `fast`, `balance`, and `detail`.

- `fast` mode: `--exhaustiveness 128` & `--max_step 20`
- `balance` mode: `--exhaustiveness 384` & `--max_step 40`
- `detail` mode: `--exhaustiveness 512` & `--max_step 40`

The larger `--exhaustiveness` and `--max_step`, the higher the computational complexity, the higher the accuracy, but the larger the computational cost.

```bash
unidock --receptor <receptor.pdbqt> \
     --gpu_batch <lig1.pdbqt> <lig2.pdbqt> ... <ligN.pdbqt> \
     --search_mode balance \
     --scoring vina \
     --center_x <center_x> \
     --center_y <center_y> \
     --center_z <center_z> \
     --size_x <size_x> \
     --size_y <size_y> \
     --size_z <size_z> \
     --num_modes 1 \
     --dir <save dir>

## Examples

We have provided a target from DUD-E dataset for screening test. Python version `>=3.6` is recommended.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Dock.git
cd Uni-Dock/example/screening_test

# target def
cp config_def.json config.json
python run_dock.py

# target mmp13
cp config_mmp13.json config.json
python run_dock.py
```

If you want to use search mode presets, specify the parameter `search_mode` in `config.json` and delete `nt` and `ns` in `config.json`.

## FAQ

1. The GPU encounters out-of-memory error.

     Uni-Dock estimates the number of ligands put into GPU memory in one pass based on the available GPU memory size. If it fails, please use `--max_gpu_memory` to limit the usage of GPU memory size by Uni-Dock.

2. I want to put all my ligands in `--gpu_batch`, but it exceeds the maximum command line length that linux can accept.
    - You can save your command in a shell script like `run.sh`, and run the command by `bash run.sh`.
    - You can save your ligands path in a file (separated by spaces) by `ls *.pdbqt > index.txt`, and use `--ligand_index index.txt` in place of `--gpu_batch`.

3. Uni-Dock computes slowly for few (<10) ligands.

     The optimal application of Uni-Dock occurs in scenarios where one binding pocket interacts with numerous (in an order of 1000) ligands. As the number of ligands within a single computational batch increases, the average processing speed improves. In instances where only a few ligands are present for one binding pocket, the overhead proportion becomes considerably large, leading to slower computational performance.

4. Which GPU architectures does Uni-Dock support?

     Starting from v1.1, Uni-Dock supports NVIDIA GPUs with [compute capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported) >= 7.0 . Uni-Dock v1.0 supports both CUDA platform for NVIDIA GPUs and ROCm platform for AMD GPUs. Since the performance optimizations are targeted at CUDA, future updates will no longer support the ROCm platform.

### Addendum to "FAQ 3 - Uni-Dock computes slowly for few (<10) ligands."

The `paired_batch` mode provides a mechanism to accelerate simultaneous 1:1 docking in batches using Vina scoring, using CUDA streams. To run docking using this mode, invoke unidock with the parameter `--paired_batch_size` value >0, with the protein:ligand configurations passed in JSON form using `--ligand_index`. The JSON file should use schema defined in paired_batching.schema.json.

A sample input data.json is as below, complying to the schema:

```json
{
    "7LCU": {
        "protein": "molecular_docking/PoseBuster/7LCU/7LCU_receptor.pdbqt",
        "ligand": "molecular_docking/PoseBuster/7LCU/7LCU_ligand_prep.sdf",
        "ligand_config": "molecular_docking/PoseBuster/7LCU/docking_grid.json"
    },
    "7KZ9": {
        "protein": "molecular_docking/PoseBuster/7KZ9/7KZ9_receptor.pdbqt",
        "ligand": "molecular_docking/PoseBuster/7KZ9/7KZ9_ligand_prep.sdf",
        "ligand_config": "molecular_docking/PoseBuster/7KZ9/docking_grid.json"
    }
}
```

A typical usage using paired_batch mode is as shown below, with batch size of 10.

```bash
unidock --paired_batch_size 10 --ligand_index data_pb1.json --size_x 25 --size_y 25 --size_z 25 --dir test/prof_25_1024_80 --exhaustiveness 1024 --max_step 80 --seed 5
```

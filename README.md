**Uni-Dock** is a GPU-accelerated molecular docking program developed by DP Technology.
It supports various scoring functions including vina, vinardo, and ad4. Uni-Dock achieves more than 2000-fold speed-up on V100 GPU with high-accuracy compared with the AutoDock Vina running in single CPU core.
The [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01145) has been accepted by JCTC (doi: 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01145).

**Uni-Dock** joins the DeepModeling community, a community devoted of AI for science, as an incubating level project. [Learn more about DeepModeling](https://github.com/deepmodeling/community)

Please check [`unidock` folder](./unidock/) for installing instructions, source codes, and usage.

**Uni-Dock Tools** is a Python package developed to handle the inputs and outputs of Uni-Dock.
It is committed to support more input formats and scoring functions. We hope it could be an easy-to-use virtual screening workflow for users with diversed backgrounds.

Please check [`unidock_tools` folder](./unidock_tools/) for installing instructions, source codes, and usage.

---

To evaluate the performance and accuracy under a uniform standard, we created **Uni-Dock Benchmarks** based on public datasets and papers.
The benchmarks are publicly available at <https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Dock-Benchmarks>.
